    <p> I was born on nov 1st 2007 I was born in the seattle hospital. I was very light when I came out the womb but docter said I was a healthy baby.
      As a kid I was very sensetive but I got stronger and less sensetive as a kid growing up my favorite resteraunt was a asian resteruant called loving hut
      or a resteraunt called clay pit it was a indian cusine. Its a expensive but its a very good and tasty resteraunt my fav thing on the menu is the
      shai paneer with the garlic naan its a very spicy but very flavored dish. My favorite drink with it is mango lassi its a sweet drink with a mango 
      flavor in it and it has alot of sugar but its very flavorful and tasty. </p>
