    <p> I was born on nov 1st 2007 I was born in the seattle hospital. I was very light when I came out the womb but docter said I was a healthy baby.
      As a kid I was very sensetive but I got stronger and less sensetive as a kid growing up my favorite resteraunt was a asian resteruant called loving hut
      or a resteraunt called clay pit it was a indian cusine. Its a expensive but its a very good and tasty resteraunt my fav thing on the menu is the
      shai paneer with the garlic naan its a very spicy but very flavored dish. My favorite drink with it is mango lassi its a sweet drink with a mango 
      flavor in it and it has a lot of sugar but its very flavorful and tasty. I grew up as a kid playing basketball. I always played outside with my
    family and neighbors the good old days were so fun wheb we didnt have to worry about school,but we all grow up. I always will remember those days, My
    mom and dad are the best people in my life they raised me right for example people these days are all into other things but im focused.
    When I was little my favorite park was spruce park that park was a fun place to go to its very sad how its known for a shooting now. I think family
    moments matter the most because Its the most important thing to do in life family is what we all need to hangout with more. I like making food, I
    make a dish called panneer Its a cheese you can put gravy sauce over I like to make my mom paneer all the time. I do it because I want to 
    feed my mom food too like she did as a kid. My dad I like to make him burgers, he likes my burgers a lot I just love cooking and making food for family.
    I remember as a kid I got injured I fell on a sharp rock and it cut my leg open it was very painful my dad and mom were the ones who helped it recover
    I didnt have to get stitches luckily. That happened in kindergarten. As a kid I played basketball and I still do overtime I got better at the sport im
    planning to play in highschool next year. My dream is to work in microsoft or amazon I just want to make money in the future. I want to celebrate that with 
    my family and my friends. I love eating roti its a indian dough that taste really good the instructions are down below on how to make the roti.
