  <p> My basketball career started in 2nd grade when I was very small and I was starting to play it. I was very nervous but over time I got better and 
   better. The picture on the very left is me being done with my basketbakll game that game I had 12 points and a couple blocks I was trying my hardest
   that game we won the game the team was very happy just like me too. The middle picture is me and my cousin at our basketball game. We ended up losing that
   game because the other team played very tough, I played decently well I made a couple of points. The picture to the very right is my basektabll team in 8th
   grade the coach is the man in the hat he was a very good coach he always pushed us to be our best version of ourselves in basetball. That season we were
   undefeated we won every game and didnt lose one game we had alot of pressure on if we lose a game will oour record go away we were known as one of 
   the best teams in that season. Our team averaged about 60 points a game we all had very good team work and dedication to this sport. We were winning every
   game so then the coach told us if we keep this up we go to the tournament. We kept winning and winning our games then we got a call from our coach to go to 
   the tournament. On the way to the tournament I was very nervous I had butterflies in my stomach a term used for being nervous. When I reached there I was 
   warming up with my team we did shooting drills, then the game finally started I did the tip off, I did not get the ball we backed up and got in our places to defend the hoop
   the team made a point we got the ball back we locked in our eyes were on the ball we stole the ball passed it to our team mate then he went to the hoop made
   the point, we repeated that many times and then the score was 43-17 it was working then we beat this team completely then we had one more game, The last game
   was the most important part we won tip off my cousin got the ball and bam he made a three pointer the first shot of the game!  We defended the hoop from them
   and they didnt make a shot, we noticed this team is not very skilled so we took it easy on them and we let them make some points but then we started trying more
   and then we splashed a shot back to back. The score was 55-9 it was too easy for us, there was 2 mins left we kept making shots back to back our team was on fire! 
   then we let them make points then we won the tournament completely! We flamed them our coach was so proud of us my mom was so proud of me and my team
   then we all talked about how our team season was great, he said we have a pizza party today we left and went straight there. I ate a lot of pizza we played basketball
   against the adults and of course adults won then he gave us trophies and he said thank you for joining my team this year. He gave us advice for summer 
   to keep playing and join next year and then that was the end of it we all said bye to eachother and It just really was a overall great season and 
   he was the best coach ive ever had! </p>
